# NTRU Lattice

### Definition (NTRU)

Since its introduction in 1998, several versions of NTRU have emerged in the literature.  
NTRU is now recognized as a hard problem in cryptography rather than a unique cryptosystem that can be extended to different algebraic structures.  
The NTRU design and the problem can be outlined as:

**NTRU:**  
Let $N$ be a prime, $q$ be a positive integer, and $f,g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]/\langle x^N-1\rangle$ be two polynomials with small coefficients (mostly ternary) such that $f$ is invertible modulo $q$.  
The pair $(f,g)$ forms the secret key and  

$$
h = f^{-1} \ast g \pmod{q} \in \mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\langle x^N-1\rangle
$$

is the public key. The NTRU problem asks to find the private key or its rotations $(x^i \ast f, x^i \ast g)$.

The most renowned technique to attack the NTRU problem is to solve SVP in the $2N$-dimensional lattice $\Lambda_{CS}$ generated by the basis

$$
\mathcal{M}_{CS} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    I_N & \mathcal{H} \\
    0_N & qI_N
\end{pmatrix},
$$

since the vector $(\mathbf{f}, \mathbf{g})$ associated with the private key $(f,g)$ or its rotations are the shortest vectors in the lattice $\Lambda_{CS}$ with high probability.
